	// ClaudeV1_100K is an enhanced version of claude-v1 with a 100,000 token (roughly 75,000 word) context window. Ideal
	// for summarizing, analyzing, and querying long documents and conversations for nuanced understanding of complex
	// topics and relationships across very long spans of text.
	ClaudeV1_100K
	// ClaudeInstantV1 is a smaller model with far lower latency, sampling at roughly 40 words/sec! Its output quality
	// is somewhat lower than the latest claude-v1 model, particularly for complex tasks. However, it is much less
	// expensive and blazing fast. We believe that this model provides more than adequate performance on a range of
	// tasks including text classification, summarization, and lightweight chat applications, as well as search result
	// summarization.
	ClaudeInstantV1
	// ClaudeInstantV1_100K is n enhanced version of claude-instant-v1 with a 100,000 token context window that retains
	// its performance. Well-suited for high throughput use cases needing both speed and additional context, allowing
	// deeper understanding from extended conversations and documents.
	ClaudeInstantV1_100K
	// ClaudeV1_3 is claude-v1.3. ompared to claude-v1.2, it's more robust against red-team inputs, better at precise
	// instruction-following, better at code, and better and non-English dialogue and writing.

	// ClaudeV1_3_100K is n enhanced version of claude-v1.3 with a 100,000 token (roughly 75,000 word) context window.
	ClaudeV1_3_100K
	// ClaudeV1_2 is an improved version of claude-v1. It is slightly improved at general helpfulness, instruction
	// following, coding, and other tasks. It is also considerably better with non-English languages. This model also
	// has the ability to role play (in harmless ways) more consistently, and it defaults to writing somewhat longer
	// and more thorough responses.

	// ClaudeV1_0 is an earlier version of claude-v1.

	// ClaudeInstantV1_1 is Anthropic's latest version of claude-instant-v1. It is better than claude-instant-v1.0 at a
	// wide variety of tasks including writing, coding, and instruction following. It performs better on academic
	// benchmarks, including math, reading comprehension, and coding tests. It is also more robust against red-teaming
	// inputs.
	ClaudeInstantV1_1
	// ClaudeInstantV1_1_100K is an enhanced version of claude-instant-v1.1 with a 100,000 token context window that
	// retains its lightning fast 40 word/sec performance.
